# Audio Signal Processing Project

Individual project assigned as part of the EE320 class. The provided scenario had two microphones recording, spaced equivilent to ears on a head. Two speech signals are incident on these microphones from two angles, as well as a sinusoidal noise source. The task was to isolate each speech signal, and filter out the noise.

Solving this problem involved analysis in the time and frequency domains, creation of a filter using z transform as well as an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter.
